# Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) Engine

## Overview
The Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) Engine is designed to monitor player performance and adjust game difficulty in real-time. By analyzing player success rate, speed, and error patterns, the DDA Engine helps maintain an optimal “flow” state, ensuring that players are consistently engaged and appropriately challenged.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Performance Tracking**: Collects data on player success rate, speed, and common errors.
- **Adaptive Difficulty Scaling**: Increases or decreases game difficulty based on player performance.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Thresholds for difficulty adjustment can be tuned to fit different games and player needs.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dynamic-difficulty-adjustment-engine.git
   cd dynamic-difficulty-adjustment-engine
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. **Import and Initialize the DDA Engine**
   - Import the `MetricsTracker`, `DifficultyAdjuster`, and `DDAEngine` classes from `src`.
   - Instantiate `MetricsTracker` and `DifficultyAdjuster`, then integrate them into the game loop.

2. **Run Example Game Loop**
   - An example game loop is provided in `examples/example_game_loop.py`.
   - To run the example:
     ```bash
     python examples/example_game_loop.py
     ```

3. **Customizing Parameters**
   - Modify thresholds and rules in `difficulty_adjuster.py` to tune the DDA engine for different games.

## Examples

The `examples/` folder contains sample scripts to demonstrate the engine’s functionality:
- **`example_game_loop.py`**: A simple game loop that simulates player performance and shows how difficulty adapts.
- **`sample_data.py`**: Provides simulated player data to test the DDA Engine under different conditions.

---

## Future Enhancements
- **Machine Learning for Predictive Adjustments**: Use historical data to predict player engagement, further personalizing difficulty adjustments.
- **Emotion-Driven Adaptation**: Integrate emotion detection to modify difficulty based on player engagement levels.
- **Expanded Difficulty Options**: Incorporate additional adaptive parameters, such as task complexity and time limits.
